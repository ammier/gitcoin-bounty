# **Bounty Title: Create Dashboards on Dune Analytics**
## Description


_Prize Bounty_

_USD 3,500_

## **Part 1: Problem Description**

**Welcome!** Thank you for your interest in our Bounty Programme. Please [Join Our Discord Server](https://discord.gg/HJ9YEpgS)

**Background**: Charged Particles is a protocol that allows users to deposit ERC-20, ERC-721, or ERC-1155 tokens (ANY tokens) into an NFT. A scarce NFT (e.g. Art, Collectible, Virtual Real Estate, In-Game Item, any NFT) can now be transformed into a basket holding a number of other tokens. Charged Particles are Interest-bearing Non-Fungible Tokens (DeFi NFTs) and the amount of interest earned from the token represents the amount of “Charge” that the particle has amassed.

**Context**: In the bid to correlate our Marketing activities and Product changes to user activity, we need to read actionable data to inform our decision making process.  Ideally, we want to be able to track key events and activities that occur on our protocol like when a proton is sold, energized, etc. Below is a list of some key events and activities (**to be updated**).

#### __Questions to answer with your dashboard__


Would like to see on both Polygon & Ethereum.

- How many protons have been sold on CP? On OpenSea or other platforms?
- How many protons have been created?
- How many protons have been Energized on CP?
- How many active users?
- How many non-protons (whitelisted contracts e.g. Rarible) have been energized on CP?
- What is the current "TVL" of the protocol? i.e. How much value (ERC20s only) is locked in -Charged Particles' NFTs? Broken out into Protons energized & non0-protons energized.
- How many Charged Particles have other NFTs nested inside of them?

#### __Example Actions/Events to track (you may need to add more than this to answer the questions above)__


- When a Proton is set for sale
- When a Proton is Energized with an ERC20
- When an ERC20 is released from a Particle
- When a Proton is Energized with an ERC721 or 1155
- When an ERC721 or 1155 is released from a Particle
- When a Proton has a timelock set
  
**The Challenge**: Please create dashboards on Dune Analytics. The dashboards will consist of table titles and axes we want to see. See format below.

***Title***:

***X-axis***:

***Y-axis***:



| Chart |                Title                 | X-Axis |                    Y-Axis                     |
| :---: | :----------------------------------: | :----: | :-------------------------------------------: |
|   1   |           Protons Created            |  Days  |           Count of Protons Created            |
|   2   |           Protons Charged            |  Days  |           Count of Protons Charged            |
|   3   |         Non-Protons Charged          |  Days  |         Count of Non-Protons Charged          |
|   4   |      Total Value Deposited ($$)      |  Days  |                   Value ($)                   |
|   5   |        Total Charge Generated        |  Days  |      Value of Total Charge Generated ($)      |
|   6   |          Total NFTs Nested           |  Days  |          Count of Total NFTs Nested           |
|   7   | Total Charged Particles Active Users |  Days  | Count of Total Charged Particles Active Users |

Note – You can use this below sample dashboard for OpenSea as a guide.

- ***Title***: OpenSea Monthly Volume, ***X-axis***: Time in months, ***Y-axis***: Total ****USD sales volume
